## üéÆ About the Game

Minesweeper is a classic single-player logic-based game. Players reveal squares on a grid, attempting to avoid hidden mines. Each revealed square may contain a number indicating how many mines surround it. The objective is to reveal all safe squares without detonating any bombs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Follows classic Minesweeper rules with new UI elements.
- Multiple difficulty levels and custom mode.
- Flagging system for suspected bombs.
- Game timer with win/loss detection.
- Replay system to review player moves.
- Hidden Easter egg on game over prompt.
- Designed with modular OOP structure in Java.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Java Swing (GUI components: `JFrame`, `JButton`, etc.)  
  - AWT Event Model (`ActionEvent`, `ActionListener`)  
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, NetBeans

## üß± System Architecture

| Class Name      | Responsibility |
|------------------|----------------|
| `StartWindow`    | Launches the game and main menu |
| `Menu`           | Handles difficulty selection |
| `GameBoard`      | Manages the grid and game logic |
| `GameSquare`     | Represents each square on the board |
| `SmartSquare`    | Handles right-click events |
| `FansyButton`    | Custom buttons with enhanced UI |
| `Bomb`           | Bomb placement logic |
| `ProduceBomb`    | Random bomb generation |
| `CheckSquare`    | Handles recursive reveal logic |
| `TimeChecker`    | Game timer tracking |
| `GameMove`       | Stores move history |
| `ReplayManager`  | Replays previous moves |

## üìã Functional Requirements

- Start menu for game and difficulty selection.
- Grid with randomly placed bombs.
- Reveal/flag squares via left/right-click.
- Recursive reveal of blank zones.
- Timer starts at game start and stops on end.
- Win when all non-bomb squares are revealed.
- Lose when clicking on a bomb.

---

## üí° Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast response time (< 100ms per interaction).
- Board setup within 1 second.
- Portable across OSes supporting Java (Windows/macOS/Linux).
- Clean, modular code with comments and reusable classes.

---

## üìà Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Grid**: 2D array to represent board.
- **Recursion**: For revealing all contiguous empty squares.
- **Stack**: To manage game move history and replay.
- **Sorting algorithms**: Used for score or data management (optional).
